In this game there are two players, the player who makes three of their marks in row and column or one of the two diagonals wins the game. When the board fills up and no combination making then the game is in draw state.

There are some rules that we are going to define here is that as we know the primary thing is move, here the player cannot undo that move. By clicking on the box he can make a move as soon as the move is done, the game proceeded to give a chance to another player.

At each move, it will show whose player moves it is either is A or it is B
